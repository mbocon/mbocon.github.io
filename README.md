Game flow :

Player 1 starts by dragging and dropping submarines to player grid<br>
Once player board is set-up Player starts game by targeting/clicking an enemy grid<br>
If hidden enemy is located on the selected square the background-color of that square will change to red to indicate a hit<br>
If no enemy is present background-color changes to teal to indicate a miss<br>
After player selects an enemy square CPU retaliates by selecting a random player square<br>
If player square holds a ship and CPU selects correctly color of player ship will change to red to indicate a hit<br>
